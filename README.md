# Card Champions

Welcome challenger, you have been tasked with an almost impossible task: to defeat the Card Champion. Read the ancient papyrus to gain the secret knowledge essential to win, and may the random JavaScript algorithm be with you.

## Purpose of this project

I have created this project with few goals in mind:

- Put my newly learnt, and rather basic, digital drawing skills to use  
  (I accumulated over 20 hours of drawing practice, including this project)
- Expand my current skills by putting it all together (drawing, programming, designing, etc.)
- Avoid getting 'rusty' with React and coding while I am job hunting
- This project was laid out as a foundation for my bigger project that I plan to do in the future, after I sharpen my skills much more

## Future Development

Few things I want to add to this project in future updates:

- Dynamic background theme
- Custom made battle music
- Volume controls for the music
- Bonus development diary video, highlighting the process from start to finish  
   (including challenges faced, commentary and so forth)
