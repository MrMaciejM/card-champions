## Purpose Of This Project

I have created this project with few goals in mind:

- Put my newly learnt, and rather basic, digital drawing skills to use  
  (I accumulated over 20 hours of drawing practice, including this project)
- Expand my current skills by putting it all together (drawing, programming, designing, etc.)
- Avoid getting 'rusty' with React and coding while I am job hunting
- This project was laid out as a foundation for my bigger project that I plan to do in the future, after I sharpen my skills much more

## Bug Fixes and Updates

Tuesday 11th July 2023

- Fixed bug with the background not rendering properly when scaled to lower resolution
- Added table of contents to the App.jsx file for easier navigation
- Cleaned up and consolidated the CSS code, removed repeated code

## Future Development

There are a few things I want to add to this project in the future updates:

- Add 'Win' / 'Loss' after the player's turn
- Minor bug fixes
- Add gameplay mechanic (secret)
- Dynamic background theme
- Custom made battle music
- Volume controls for the music and sound effects
- Bonus development diary video, highlighting the process from start to finish  
   (including challenges faced, commentary and so forth)
